# PhysiocapCIVC
This plugin is a new version of the already made plugin of @jhemmi 
new fonctionalities were aded to facilitate the using of the plugin :
  * new output files are generated : 
            - a csv file with agrnomic information on the bloc but also average value of BIOM/DIAM/NBSARM
            - a png file : a map of the bloc; the legend intervals were created based on values from last years    
  * the same structure of output files  will enable to do statistic analysis and establish a new referential of the region of Champagne       every year
