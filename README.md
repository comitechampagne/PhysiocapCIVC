# PhysiocapCIVC
This plugin is a new version of the already made plugin by @jhemmi (https://github.com/jhemmi/QgisPhysiocapPlugin)

this version was adapted to the needs of the Inter-profesionnal Commitee of Champagne Wine; new fonctionalities were aded to facilitate the using of the plugin :
  * less steps in order to have final results: 3 clics
  * new output files are generated : 
       - a csv file with agrnomic informations on the parcel but also average value of BIOM/DIAM/NBSARM
       - a png file : an interpolated map of the parcel; the legend intervals were created based on mean values from last years    
            
  * the same structure of output files  will enable the Inter-profesionnal Commitee of Champagne Wine to do statistical analysis and   
    establish a new referential of the region of Champagne every year
