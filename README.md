new fonctionalities were aded to facilitate the using of the plugin :

  * new output files are generated : 
  
            - a csv file with agrnomic information on the bloc but also average value of BIOM/DIAM/NBSARM
            
            - a png file : a map of the bloc; the legend intervals were created based on values from last years
